  "introduction": {
  "what_is_rainwater_harvesting": "Rainwater harvesting is the process of collecting, storing, filtering, and reusing rainwater for various domestic, commercial, industrial, agricultural, and public uses. It reduces water wastage, supports groundwater recharge, and ensures sustainable water availability.",
  "why_it_matters": "Freshwater resources are declining due to overextraction, climate change, and urbanization. Rainwater harvesting helps reduce dependency on groundwater, prevents flooding, recharges aquifers, and provides clean water for non-potable needs."

    "overview": "Simple household systems designed to capture rainwater from roofs and store it for domestic use such as gardening, cleaning, flushing, and groundwater recharge.",
    "steps": [
      "Identify roof catchment and measure area.",
      "Install gutters with leaf guards and first-flush filters.",
      "Connect gutters to downpipes and filters.",
